## üìñ About GMJ StarterKit

**GMJ StarterKit** is a Laravel starter template tailored for projects that require **Role-Based Authentication**. It simplifies development by providing pre-configured features, allowing you to focus on building your application's functionality.

### Key Features:

-   **Role-Based Authentication**: Default roles include `Admin` and `User`, with easy extensibility for more.
-   **Role Middleware**: Custom middleware to handle role-based access control for routes.
-   **Laravel UI Integration**: Authentication scaffolding powered by Laravel UI.
-   **Noble UI Styling**: Pre-styled authentication pages with Noble UI Bootstrap templates.

## ‚ö° Role-Based Functionality

The kit comes with two default roles:

-   **Admin**: Access admin-specific routes and functionality.
-   **User**: Access user-specific routes..

Roles are stored as enums in the users table. A custom Role Middleware is included to restrict access to routes based on roles.
